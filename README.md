# Amsterdam_airbnb_project
In this project we are going to explore a dataset with room prices in neighbourhoods in Amsterdam. To make it simple we are going to visualize correlations between prices and parameters that we will use for predicting prices. The goal of project is to predict prices based on the best parameters we found.
